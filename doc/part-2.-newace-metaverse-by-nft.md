# Part 2. NEWACE Metaverse by NFT

![](.gitbook/assets/2.png)

## **1. Overview**

**NEWACE** foundation has been developing horse racing games for more than 10 years, and the game has been certified as an international casino.

Based on this, accessibility will be expanded using the current WEB3.0 protocol and the transparency of blockchain technology will be further maximized.

The foundation will create a P2E-based blockchain world that not only ordinary fans who like horse racing, but also crypto game users can easily participate in and enjoy.

**Optimization**

Minimize 3D resources, create no-delay environment.

**Accessibility-WEB3.0**

Web3.0 protocol environment is easy to access for all devices and is optimized for P2E-based games.

**Collection**

Stimulating factors in collecting, maintaining asset value, and building collection algorithms.

The development point keywords are “Accessibility”, “Optimization”, and “Collection”, and are creating games that can be accessed anywhere in an optimized environment and stimulate collection desire.

## **2. World view**

**NEWACE** team reflected the realistic part of horse racing as much as possible through the data and know-how of more than 10 years of development and service.

![](.gitbook/assets/3.png)

A world view incorporating a fantasy of flexibility and expansion, not a limited reality concept.

The basis proceeds with a **realistic concept**, and **fantasy is applied** to areas that have limitations in collection, fun, and expression.

FUN

Acquisition of unicorns by drawing and collection of unicorns with a sparse probability of breeding.

EXPAND

Discovering a virtual continent, breeding zebroids and minting a new breed of horse.

NEWNESS

Racing under different MAP. (Resource minimization conditions)

The new **NEWACE** Metaverse combines technologies such as WEB3.0 and blockchain with the past version to create and continue to expand the worldview involving many users through **NEWACE**’s own adventure by reflecting existing strong realistic parts and fantasy elements.

## **3. NEWACE Platform**

**The NEWACE** project developed not only races but also real estate NFT for farmers, as well as RPG elements that can improve horses statistics by breeding and training horses as farm owners.

Therefore, various economic activities are available through three factors: racing, real estate, and horse, and you can achieve better results according to your efforts in NEWACE’s adventure space.

**3-1. Genetic algorithm**

The genetic algorithm of horses in the game is applied in a similar structure to the actual genetic algorithm.

Genetic algorithms are applied to all elements that are organized and classified, including the visual elements of horses.

**3-2. Racecourse**

There are 4 racecourses now and there will be more in the future.

Each racecourse has different entry levels and courses to have diverse race results.

There are designated and random racecourses in the game so that the game will be more fun.

설명 Description

It is the most speed-specific course among racecourses due to its long-term variety of improvement.

It is the birthplace of horse racing with a long history and tradition, and it has a speed-specific course that relieves the burden of racehorses.

It has a height difference between the highest section and the lowest section, and the spurt section is an uphill road and has a course specialized for the endurance and propulsion of racehorses.

It has a flat course specialized for leg strength and endurance that can withstand weight instead of speed.

**3-3. Racing**

NFT items and horses that have grown up in horse development games can compete in 1:1 individual races or a several users can race together.

Horse owners can prove the value of their horses through horse development games, and users will increase the fun of the game through individual betting.

* **Training tournament racing (PVE)**

\- Racehorses without race history cannot participate in tournament/event races and must achieve a minimum number of races in training mode to participate in PVP race.

\- At the end of the minimum required race, the racehorse will be initially rated.

\- Training race is free so you can enjoy the game and you can get $SUGAR tokens as a victory reward.

\- You can participate in more races since the horse consumes less stamina than the tournament event.

\- Participating in a training race will earn XP points, and the level and statistics will increase. Both these levels and statistics will be affected by the race.

\- High daily rewards can be obtained through daily missions for user retention.

**3-5. Breeding System**

**The more horses you breed, the stronger horses you can produce.**

* **Breeding mechanism**

Breeding is one way to make a profit in a game.

The gender of a racehorse consists of a male horse (stallion stud) and a female horse (brood mare).

Breeding between a stallion stud and a brood mare can breed new NFT horses.

To breed the next generation of horses requires a stallion stud, a brood mare, and a certain amount of NEA tokens and SEED tokens in the wallet.

If you only own one horse, you can rent a stallion stud or a brood mare as a partner through an in-game breeding farm.

Racehorses cannot participate in race during breeding.

* **Breeding limitation**

Breeding restrictions are applied to maintain the value of racehorses at a stable price in the ecosystem.

\* \[ Regulation on breeding restrictions ]

Stallion stud (male horse): 3 times a month/ 36 times a year

Brood mare (female horse): once a month/ 12 times a year

* **Gene algorithm (GA)**

The breeding system of **NEWACE** is calculated similarly to a combination of biological genetic algorithms.

The next generation of horses can inherit DNA from both parents.

Through various genetic combinations, it may be bred as a horse superior to its parents or may have genes different from their parents due to mutations.

**Breeding develops based on various GA conditions.**

![텍스트이(가) 표시된 사진

자동 생성된 설명](.gitbook/assets/12.png)

**Category** **Description**

\
**Gender** Gender is determined by a 50% chance of breeding.

**Breed** N kinds of horses are the standard of each horse’s lineage.

**Rarity** NEWACE rarity is made up of normal, magic, rare, epic, unique and legend units, and legend contains only 1% of it.

**Feature** Genetic features are from G1 to M100, and the smaller the number, the higher the statistics.

**Tendency** It means the personality or type of a horse. There will be various results in the race depending on the tendency of the horse, and you will have the same fun as real horse racing.

**Gene** Gene is genetic features, including recessive gene and dominant gene. The higher the dominant gene level, the higher the probability of inheriting appearance or statistic during breeding.

**Lineage** There are six inherent lineages of NFT horses, and breeding horses of the same lineage increases the likelihood of inheriting genes from inherent lineage.

**Statistic** It is an inherent statistical value that a horse has, and it is not externally exposed. All horses have similar statistics, and do not win unconditionally because of their high rarity. In short, it is determined by RNG technology through racing experience, training, and genetic data.

**Visual** It is inherited by the next generation of horses through smart contracts when breeding in a form similar to a genetic algorithm. New types of NFT horses combined with their parents’ genes can be born, but the low probability of mutation can also result in new visual or statistical value.

## **4. NEWACE NFT**

**4-1. Horse NFT**

**NEWACE** project game items are issued as NFT, and all items from the horse breeding RPG game are applied as NFT. Because NFT is based on blockchain, all information, including properties and sales histories, is stored on blockchain. Therefore, it is impossible for any kind of falsification since the first issuer can be identified at any time.

Applicable items of NFT content within the game include horses, horse-riding association, jockeys, jockey’s clothes, horse trainers, horseshoes, and saddles.

Initial issuance of the items will be from the foundation. Game users can trade with each other based on NEWACE TOKEN later on. In short, users empower all of **NEWACE** PROJECT’s items.

_The images above are for clarity and they can be changed if NFT issues arise._

**NEWACE** is composed of the same type as an actual racehorse and has various features, but its rarity and features are different.
